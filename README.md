This project is a basic to intermediate AI Agent that integrates Google’s Gemini API with a modern tech stack. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, providing a robust and scalable API that leverages Gemini’s generative capabilities to process and generate content based on user inputs. 

The integration is designed to support multiple tools such as web search, text summarization, real-time data information, adding Amazon products, and email composition, making it versatile for various automation tasks.

On the frontend, the application is developed with Next.js and React, styled with TailwindCSS to deliver a responsive and visually appealing user interface. 

Users can interact with the agent by entering text prompts or using voice commands, which are captured and converted to text via the Web Speech API. 

This seamless integration of speech-to-text functionality allows for an intuitive, hands-free experience, enhancing both accessibility and usability.

The architecture of this project is modular, enabling easy expansion and customization. 

This project not only facilitates rapid development in automation but also lays the groundwork for incorporating additional features like conversation memory.

Overall, this AI Agent project exemplifies a sophisticated approach serves as an ideal foundation for hackathons and production-level applications, showcasing how integrated AI solutions can streamline and enhance user interactions across various domains.
